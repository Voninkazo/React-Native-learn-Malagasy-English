This project is built with react native. It is an application that helps people to learn both English and Malagasy. Find it on [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learngasy&hl=en&gl=US) and start.

In a team of three developers, I worked on building the components and some of the UI. We use storybooks to test the components and Redux as a state management. Together we implemented the functionalities and got the app working without props driling.
